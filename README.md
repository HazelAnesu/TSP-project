## What is inside this repository

This repository contains files for an investigation into the Travelling Salesman Problem using both quantum and classical computing methods. The files included are:

* Classical Methods
	* Deterministic Methods
		* Exhaustive Search
		* Branch and Bound
		* Dynammic Programming
	* Heuristic Methods
		* Simulated Annealing
		* Nearest Neighbour


* Quantum Methods
	        * VQE 


## How to use

The data folder contains datasets from the TSPLIB. This project will use distance matrices for all experiments. The datasets downloaded from the TSPLIB are text files that will be formatted into an acceptable format for the algorithms. This process is done using the "formatting" function
